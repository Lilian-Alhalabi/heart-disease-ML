# heart-disease-ML
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict heart disease based on clinical features.  The dataset includes patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.  Using this data, the model provides a **preliminary diagnosis** for new patients from a CSV or Excel file.
