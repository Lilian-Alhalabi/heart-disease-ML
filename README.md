# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🫀🤖

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict heart disease based on clinical features. 
The dataset includes patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more. 
Using this data, the model provides a **preliminary diagnosis** for new patients from a CSV or Excel file.

The project highlights:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing and feature scaling
- Training multiple ML models including Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
- User-friendly prediction for new patients

## Dataset Columns
The following features are used for prediction:

- `age` – Age of the patient  
- `sex` – Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)  
- `cp` – Chest pain type  
- `trestbps` – Resting blood pressure  
- `chol` – Serum cholesterol  
- `fbs` – Fasting blood sugar  
- `restecg` – Resting ECG results  
- `thalach` – Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `exang` – Exercise-induced angina  
- `oldpeak` – ST depression induced by exercise  
- `slope` – Slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
- `ca` – Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy  
- `thal` – Thalassemia

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to provide **preliminary heart disease predictions**.  
The Random Forest model achieved strong accuracy on the dataset and can classify new patients reliably.

By allowing users to upload their patient data (CSV or Excel), this tool makes ML-powered predictions **accessible and user-friendly** for healthcare applications.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **preliminary diagnostic tool**. It should **not replace professional medical advice**. Always consult a healthcare professional for clinical diagnosis.
